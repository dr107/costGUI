**Some notes on Input**

*Name:* Refers to the name of something you're buying *(e.g. coffee)*

*Price:* Exactly what it sounds like. Make sure to format this as a number *(e.g. 2.11)*

*Date:* This is probably what you're here about. Many forms of input are acceptable. The
one given in the defaults *(e.g. July 23 2013)* is the least ambiguous, and therefore 
probably the best idea. That said, the following would be equivalent (assuming it's 
the 25th of the same month and year):

July 23

jul 23

Tuesday

tue

*Category:* This is other thing you're likely here about. This is mainly for analysis purposes.
I wanted to include some notion of a 'breakdown' functionality so that you can get some idea of
where your monthly expenses are going, but it really doesn't make sense to do this on an item-by-
item basis. So, when you add 'lunch' to the record, put it in the category 'food,' or 'eating out'.
It's all a matter of how much information you want to record.
